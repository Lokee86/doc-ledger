# Watcher and Automation

doc-ledger has a watch mode for long-running docs maintenance, but it is still a convenience layer. Use `check` when you want a clean verification gate before commit or CI.

## Watch Commands

- `doc-ledger fix --root docs`
- `doc-ledger check --root docs`
- `doc-ledger watch --root docs`
- `doc-ledger watch --root docs --once`

`doc-ledger watch --help` shows the watch-specific flags and examples.

`--once` runs a single reconciliation pass and exits. Regular watch mode runs one reconciliation pass immediately, then keeps observing the docs tree recursively.
Watch mode runs in the foreground by default. `doc-ledger` does not daemonize or own background lifecycle.

## What Watch Mode Does

Watch mode is built to rerun reconciliation when the docs tree changes.

- It starts with an initial fix so the tree is reconciled before observation begins.
- It watches the configured root recursively.
- It reacts to relevant file events and directory create, delete, and move events.
- It debounces bursts of changes.
- It runs one fix at a time.
- If changes arrive during a fix, it schedules one more pass after the current run finishes.
- It ignores configured ignored directories and ignored filename suffixes.
- It applies the same include and exclude rules used by scanning when deciding whether a file event matters.

The watcher prints timestamped status lines and includes the current process ID in its startup line. That makes it easier to spot watcher/fix races in logs.

## Practical Usage

Watch mode is useful while iterating locally, but it is not a replacement for `check`.

- Use `watch` while editing docs and fixtures.
- Use `check` before commit or in CI.
- Expect `fix` to report `0` updated files when the watcher already reconciled the tree for you.

## Safer Detached Example

If you run doc-ledger from a shell startup file, keep the launch explicit and let the wrapper handle the guard logic:

```bash
DOC_LEDGER_ROOT="${DOC_LEDGER_ROOT:-docs}"

doc_ledger_pid_file="$PWD/.cache/doc-ledger-watch.pid"
doc_ledger_log_file="$PWD/.cache/doc-ledger-watch.log"

mkdir -p "$PWD/.cache"

doc_ledger_watch_is_running() {
  [ -s "$doc_ledger_pid_file" ] || return 1

  local watcher_pid
  watcher_pid="$(cat "$doc_ledger_pid_file" 2>/dev/null)" || return 1

  case "$watcher_pid" in
    ''|*[!0-9]*) return 1 ;;
  esac

  kill -0 "$watcher_pid" 2>/dev/null || return 1
  ps -p "$watcher_pid" -o args= 2>/dev/null | grep -Fq "doc-ledger watch"
}

start_doc_ledger_watch() {
  setsid bash -c '
    cd "$1" || exit 1
    exec doc-ledger watch --root "$2" </dev/null >>"$3" 2>&1
  ' _ "$PWD" "$DOC_LEDGER_ROOT" "$doc_ledger_log_file" >/dev/null 2>&1 &

  echo $! > "$doc_ledger_pid_file"
}

if ! doc_ledger_watch_is_running; then
  rm -f "$doc_ledger_pid_file"
  start_doc_ledger_watch
fi

unset doc_ledger_pid_file
unset doc_ledger_log_file
```

When using `direnv`, source process startup files outside any `set -a` block so helper variables such as PID and log paths are not exported.

This pattern keeps the process start explicit, writes logs to `.cache/doc-ledger-watch.log`, and avoids relying on shell aliases during startup.

## Output

Watcher logs include timestamped status lines such as:

```text
2026-06-18T23:59:59 doc-ledger watch watching docs pid=12345
2026-06-18T23:59:59 doc-ledger watch updated 3 file(s)
```

Those timestamps make it easier to understand the order of events when a fix pass and a file change happen close together.
